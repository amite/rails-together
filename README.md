rails-together
===============

Repository contains a codebase for application which is being developed with people from G+ community for learning purposes. [#rubyonrails@google plus](https://plus.google.com/communities/102406850580404903942)


What we are Building
====================

We created a sruvey [here](https://plus.google.com/110334580123660644717/posts/1EHKuSo9HUW) to select what kind of application we are going to build. At the end we choose 'Personal Finance Manager'.

List of application features, bugs was entered to [Pivotal Tracker](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/projects/739579).

Tools
=====
There is a discussion happening about tools right now [here](https://plus.google.com/110334580123660644717/posts/ZSqWeakjJTU)

We haven't decide yet what tools, gems, libraries, etc. we are going to used. I think we should choose them after we decide what kind of app we want to write and what features we are going to build.

For now I just want to suggest to develop our application using BDD methodology so Cucumber and RSpec should be our friends.

Working methodology
===================

We want to try pair programming but are not sure yet how we could do this. Looking forward for your ideas.
