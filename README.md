rails-together
===============

This is an open source project Repository for people who are new to learning rails. If you want to learn rails, by actually building something real, you should join in. You can find existing members at the [#rubyonrails G+ community](https://plus.google.com/communities/102406850580404903942)


What we are Building
====================

We created a survey [here](https://plus.google.com/110334580123660644717/posts/1EHKuSo9HUW) to vote on the kind of application we were going to build. At the end we chose 'Personal Finance Manager'.

A List of application features, bugs has been recently entered to [Pivotal Tracker](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/projects/739579).

Tools
=====
There is a discussion happening about tools right now [here](https://plus.google.com/110334580123660644717/posts/ZSqWeakjJTU)

We haven't decide yet what tools, gems, libraries, etc. we are going to used. I think we should choose them after we decide what kind of app we want to write and what features we are going to build.

For now I just want to suggest to develop our application using BDD methodology so Cucumber and RSpec should be our friends.

Working methodology
===================

We want to try pair programming but are not sure yet how we could do this. Looking forward for your ideas.
