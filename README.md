rails-together
===============

Repository contains a codebase for application which is developed with people from G+ community for learning purposes.

Application
===========

We haven't decide yet what application we want to write.

Already proposed:
+ CMS with dynamic attributes
+ Social bookmarking tool

If have any idea for the web app, please fill free to update this file or just open an issue.

Tools
=====

We haven't decide yet what tools, gems, libraries, etc. we are going to used. I think we should choose them after we decide what kind of app we want to write.

For now I just want to suggest to develop our application using BDD methodology so Cucumber and RSpec should be our friends.

Working methodology
===================

I suggest to try pair programming but I'm not sure yet how we could do this. I look forward for your ideas.
